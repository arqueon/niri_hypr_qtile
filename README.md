#### Replace PulseAudio with PipeWire

This configuration utilizes PipeWire for audio management. If you prefer to use PulseAudio, modify the `waybar` configuration to use the `pulseaudio` module instead of the `wireplumber` module.

1. Remove PulseAudio:

       sudo pacman -Rdd pulseaudio

2. Install PipeWire:
 
       sudo pacman -S pipewire-{jack,alsa,pulse}
       systemctl --user enable --now pipewire pipewire-pulse 
  
#### Configuring Fusuma for Qtile (optional)

A functional configuration file (`fusuma/config.yml`) is already included in this repository. This provides a solid foundation for customization. You can modify this file to define your preferred gestures and actions, tailoring the experience to your specific needs.
