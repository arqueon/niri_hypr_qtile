#### Replace PulseAudio with PipeWire

This configuration utilizes PipeWire for audio management. If you prefer to use PulseAudio, modify the `waybar` configuration to use the `pulseaudio` module instead of the `wireplumber` module.

1. Remove PulseAudio:

       sudo pacman -Rdd pulseaudio

2. Install PipeWire:
 
       sudo pacman -S pipewire-{jack,alsa,pulse}
       systemctl --user enable --now pipewire pipewire-pulse

#### Configuring Fusuma for Qtile (optional)

This setup integrates [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma), a versatile tool that enables you to control your Qtile environment using intuitive touchpad gestures. 

A functional configuration file (`fusuma/config.yml`) is already included in this repository. This provides a solid foundation for customization. You can modify this file to define your preferred gestures and actions, tailoring the experience to your specific needs.

[How to Install and Customize Fusuma](https://dev.to/iberianpig/how-to-install-and-customize-fusuma-73l) 

This guide provides detailed instructions on:

* Installing Fusuma
* Configuring gestures for your touchpad
* Customizing actions for each gesture
* Integrating Fusuma with Qtile

By following the steps outlined in the guide, you can set up and customize `fusuma` to switch your Qtile wokspaces using touchpad gestures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/arqueon/niri_hypr_qtile.git

2. Copy the desired configuration files to your `$HOME` directory.

3. Restart your window manager or log out and back in.


## Configuration Customization. Make it your own!

This repository provides a minimal foundation for setting up your workspace with Niri and Hyprland. But don't stop there! Adapt it to your liking and needs.

### Here's how

* **Explore the configuration files:** Dive into the files within the repository. Each one controls a specific aspect, allowing for granular customization.

* **Consult the documentation:** For advanced options and detailed explanations, check out the official documentation for each tool:
